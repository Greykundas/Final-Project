Amazing. You actually solved the question.
How did you do that? Who helped you? Tell me!
What! No. This is not happening. Did you cheat? Of course you did, it's the only way.
That's cheating! Though, I am hardly surprised. I knew this was too difficult for you to complete.
You'll pay for this.
Are you feeling the pressure?
Keep it up, Batman-and you're going to be very, very sorry.
I thought you had a city to save? So what are you doing, wasting time with this quiz?
That's one, Batman! The water might be lower but you're still out of your depth.
Well, how clever you must feel. How smug.
Oh, very good, Batman.
Please don't think that that was some sort of victory over me. It wasn't.
Did you enjoy that, Batman? Savor it. The next thing you taste will be defeat.
